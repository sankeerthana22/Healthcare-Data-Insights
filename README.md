# 🏥 Healthcare Data Insights Project

## ✨ Project Overview

This project focuses on in-depth analysis of healthcare data to extract actionable insights, aiming to improve patient outcomes, optimize hospital operations, and identify key trends within the healthcare sector. By transforming raw data into meaningful intelligence, this project supports data-driven decision-making for healthcare providers and administrators.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To analyze patient demographics, admission patterns, and visit trends.
* To evaluate treatment outcomes and identify factors influencing patient health.
* To uncover patterns in disease prevalence and the effectiveness of different interventions.
* To assess key aspects of hospital performance, including efficiency and resource utilization.

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

Through comprehensive data analysis, this project identified critical trends and provided insights into:

* **Patient Demographics & Visits:** Analysis of patient age distribution, gender distribution, state, city, and common medical history details. Examination of visit frequency by doctor specialization and reason for visit.
* **Treatment & Lab Result Analysis:** Evaluation of treatment costs, common prescribed medications, and the volume and percentage of abnormal lab results. Insights into treatment status and outcomes.
* **Hospital Performance Metrics:** Insights into patient readmission rates, average length of stay, and overall treatment success rates.
* **Doctor Workload:** Analysis of average patients per doctor to understand workload distribution.
* **Financial Aspects:** Total amount spent by each patient on treatments, and identification of top expensive treatments.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Data Sourcing & Storage:**
    * **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for initial data preparation and cleaning of structured datasets (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Visit, Treatments, Lab Results data).
    * **SQL (MySQL/SQL Server):** Employed for robust database creation, structuring, complex data querying (e.g., `Actual Healthcare sql project.sql`), transformation (ETL processes), and ensuring data integrity with primary and foreign key relationships.
* **Data Analysis & Processing:**
    * **Python:** For advanced data processing, cleaning, and potentially statistical analysis.
* **Data Visualization & Reporting:**
    * **Power BI:** For developing interactive dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and present key findings to stakeholders.
    * **Tableau (Implicit from PPT):** Indicated as a tool for dashboard development in the project's workflow.
